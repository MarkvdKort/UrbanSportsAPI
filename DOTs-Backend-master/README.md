## Impact Measurement in Urbansports

### Introduction
Xsens DOT is a wearable sensor development platform which features sensor incorporating 3D accelerometer[1], gyroscope[2] and magnetometer[3] to provide an accurate 3D orientation.

The embedded processor in the sensor handles sampling, calibration, strap-down
integration of inertial data and the Xsens Kalman Filter core (XKFCore) algorithm for sensor fusion. With wireless data transmission through Bluetooth 5.0, Xsens DOT can provide real-time 3D orientation as well as calibrated 3D linear acceleration, angular velocity and (earth) magnetic field data to a receiving device.

Xsens DOT is the start of a new Xsens product line bringing Xsens sensor solutions to mobile device platforms. With simple-to-use Software-Development-Kit (SDK) and
comprehensive documentation, system integrators can easily develop their wearable
applications.

Through this simple-to-use SDK we are going to make a new system that analyses the data received with the Xsens DOT to get more information about the impact that sporters might endure with urban sports.

### Urban Sports Performance Centre overview
The Urban Sports Performance Centre is a national knowledge- and innovation center for urban sports. The goal of USPC is to elevate urban sports and make it more attractive by using knowledge, innovation and technology. 

The USPC was established in 2017 by InnoSportLab Sport & Beweeg! and Paramedisch Expertise Centrum Eindhoven (PECE). Their ambition is to professionalize urban sports and help their trainers by topsport and talent development and host leading events to enlarge the social impact of urban sports.

An important element of the USPC is to provide professional support to urban trainers, athletes and talents. Their support has its main focus on training theory, science technology, nutrition materials, injury prevention and career guidance. For the purpose of this they offer the provision of test and measurement facilities. These facilities are available at the field lab in area 51 in Eindhoven. When using the mobile facilities it is possible to use these at any urban training ground.



The USPC also works on developing innovations that contribute to making urban sports more fun, not only for the athletes but also for other interested parties. For these purposes they often team up with creative, technical and entrepreneurial students and knowledge and business partners.

### Reasoning behind this project
The main reason behind the project is making the perceived data from the Xsens DOT sensors more user friendly. The goal is to develop an app where the data can be presented in a format that it can and will be relevant for athletes and their trainers as well. By making the data more user friendly it can then be used to get a good insight on the impact an athlete has endured during their training, this way we can get a better understanding as to why a specific injury has occurred and work on preventing them. This way urban sports will become a safer sport as of itself and will make training even more efficient. This can be a real game changer for professional athletes.
